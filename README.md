# Why TwitterSia30Flagger

Wrote this code as a way to help people remove and clear their twitter accounts so that Governments like china and other countries don't flag them!


# What is Twitter Sia30 Flagger

It's a simple python code to identify potential tweets that may contain sensitive keywords that governments might flag them and use it against you! 
I don't mind removing my old tweets to be safe and for me it's about being safe than sorry!


<H1 style='color:red;'>Caution</H1>

Twitter free API only allows you to retrieve last 3200 tweets and you have to be pro/premium API owner to do so with a slight modification of code! 


# Usage

1. Clone or download the project  `git clone https://github.com/i3130002/TwitterSia30Flagger.git`

2. install dependencies `pip install twython`

3. Rename `Config.exp.py` to `Config.py`

4. Put your twitter `APP_KEY`and `APP_SECRET` into `Config.py`

5. Run main.py by `python main.py`
6. Type target username in response to `What username?`
7. Open `output.html` and go through tweets thus removing unnecessary ones that might be dangerous!
8. Re-Do steps 1 to 7 to make sure things are fine now !

# Future work

- [ ] `Jupyter notebook` is not in sync with `.py` files

- [ ] It has problem displaying found keywords for each tweet

- [ ] Improving sensitive words 

- [ ] Reading sensitive words from another file
